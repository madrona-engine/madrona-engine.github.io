          <h1>Madrona v0.1: A Game Engine for Training Agents</h1>

        <p>
        After about a year of work, I'm happy to announce the initial release of the Madrona Engine. Madrona is a new type of game engine designed from the ground up for the unique workload of training agents using algorithms like reinforcement learning. With this release, we hope to provide a useful platform for creating high-performance learning environments across a broad range of exciting applications such as <a href='https://openai.com/research/openai-five'>learning complex game strategies</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01975.pdf'>robotics / embodied AI</a>, and <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11105'>game development</a>.

        <h3>What makes Madrona different from existing game engines?</h3>
        <p>
        Learning environments built on Madrona are able to simulate batches of thousands of environments simultaneously <em>by default</em>, enabling high-throughput experience generation for learning. This is in contrast to existing game engines that are designed to execute a single game instance at real-time rates. By treating parallel batch execution of many environments as a first class notion in the engine, Madrona is able to map this parallel workload entirely onto the GPU and achieve order of magnitude speedups over CPU execution.

        <h3>Machine Learning Impact</h3>
        <p>
        For machine learning researchers, the massive speedups enabled by Madrona's architecture result in very tangible changes to learning workflows. For example, my colleague <a href='https://bsarkar321.github.io/'>Bidipta Sarkar</a> ported the <a href="https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai">Overcooked AI</a> environment to Madrona and achieved a <strong>60x</strong> speedup to end-to-end training. Concretely, his training runs dropped from over an hour to under a minute! In fact, you can use this <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/github/bsarkar321/madrona_rl_envs/blob/master/overcooked_compiled_colab.ipynb'>Colab notebook</a> to train Overcooked agents on a free GPU in just a couple minutes. Overall, these kind of speedups significantly improve research iteration times and open up new algorithmic possibilities. I highly recommend reading Bidipta's <a href="https://bsarkar321.github.io/blog/overcooked_madrona/index.html">blog post</a> for a detailed account of the impact on his research as well as the nitty gritty technical details of porting Overcooked AI to Madrona and optimizing it.

        <h3>Engine Architecture Overview</h3>
        <p>
        The core technical idea behind Madrona is the realization that the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture from the game industry is a great fit for batch GPU execution of many learning environments. Specifically, the overall structure and separation of code and data provided by an ECS allow Madrona to efficiently map custom learning environment logic onto the GPU by maintaining coherent execution and access patterns while also managing the complexity of linking many diverse subsystems together efficiently. If you're not familiar with the ECS architecture, I highly recommend Sander Mertens' excellent <a href='https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq'>ECS FAQ</a>, as well as <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrIY0eIyqmI'>this GDC talk</a> from one of the developers of Overwatch.
        </p>
        <p>
        Expect the next post on this blog to be a deeper dive into my reasoning behind choosing the ECS architecture for Madrona and why I think the "game engine" abstraction is extremely useful for building learning environments.

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
        Hopefully this short post has piqued your interest in learning more about the engine and perhaps playing around with it. If so, the following resources are good starting points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a href='https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_escape_room'>Madrona Escape Room</a> example project is a simple 3D environment where agents need to learn to step on buttons and push blocks to escape a series of rooms. With a high-end GPU, you should be able to train agents to solve this environment in under an hour. I recommend this environment as your starting point if you're interested in building a new environment in Madrona, as I've included inline comments and documentation on how to use the engine's ECS APIs throughout the code along with a top-level guide to code structure in the README. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to integrate with the built-in physics and visualization functionality in the engine.
