            <p>
            About a year ago, I became interested in the following question: <em>What would a game engine designed from the ground up for training agents look like?</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            For context, training agents in virtual environments with algorithms like reinforcement learning requires huge amounts of experience: agents must take hundreds of millions or <a href='https://wijmans.xyz/publication/ddppo-2019/'>even billions</a> of simulated steps to learn complex tasks. Generating all this experience is a challenging task: imagine a standard game engine designed to run at 60 or even 120 frames per second. Generating a billion steps sequentially would take almost 100 days of real-world time to train agents, not even counting the time needing for learning!
